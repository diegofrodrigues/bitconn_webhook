# n8n example workflows for Odoo Webhook

This folder contains importable n8n workflows that call the Odoo Webhook endpoint provided by the custom module `bitconn_webhook`.

Start here
- 00-odoo-webhook-all-flows.json: a single base workflow with all flows. Set "flow" to choose which branch to run (e.g. create_contact, update_contact, create_lead, update_lead, create_sale_order, create_invoice, post_sale_order_message, post_channel_message).

How to use
- Import any JSON file into n8n (top-right menu â†’ Import from file).
- Open the "Set Config" node and set your values:
  - base_url: your Odoo base URL (e.g., http://localhost:8069)
  - webhook_uuid: from the Webhook form in Odoo
  - secret: the Secret Key from the same Webhook
- Run the workflow. Each workflow uses HTTP Request nodes with Authorization: Bearer <secret>.

Notes
- Methods supported: create, write, unlink, read, search.
- search returns only ids by default; pass fields to get full records.
- Use proper Odoo ORM relation formats for values (many2one id, many2many/one2many command lists).
- These are minimal examples; adapt fields to your instance (company/journal/pricelist may change defaults).
